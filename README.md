# vocal-cues-for-Parkinson-disease-detection
This project aims to detect Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using vocal biomarkers extracted from real-time or recorded voice samples. Leveraging both classical and advanced machine learning techniques, the system provides accurate, non-invasive early-stage detection based on voice patterns.
